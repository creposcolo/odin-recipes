# odin-recipes
Recipe Project from TOP Foundations

This is the first project from the Foundations course of "The Odin Project." It's a simple website for recipes, and by the end should demonstrate my ability to write basic code in HTML--covering all the pieces I've learned so far from TOP--and, ideally, my ability to do it all while writing meaningful and followable commit messages.

At some point, my understanding is that I'll be returning to this project after learning CSS and JavaScript and make the website a bit fancier.
